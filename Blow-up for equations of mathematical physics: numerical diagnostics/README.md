# Blow-up Phenomena in Mathematical Physics: Numerical Methods

This repository provides a numerical analysis of the blow-up phenomenon in mathematical tasks related to physics. The methods presented are based on Richardson's theory for effective accuracy evaluation. The core idea is to determine the effective accuracy order during the process of solving smooth solutions, making significant changes in the effective accuracy order a proof of the existence of blow-up solutions.

## Overview

The study focuses on three main analytical methods for blow-up phenomena:

1. **Nonlinear Capacity Method:** Presented by S. I. Pohozhaeva using trial functions, and E. Mitidiert's method with different selections.

2. **Dynamical Approach:** Proposed by H. A. Levine and its variations, detailed in the book.

3. **Self-Similar Regularization Method:** Introduced by A. A. Samarsky, V. A. Galaktionov, S. P. Kurdyumov, and A. P. Mikhailova. Based on comparing different characteristics.

## Tasks and Challenges

Numerical studies on "blow-up of solutions under extreme conditions" pose several challenges:

1. Obtaining the blow-up of solutions as time approaches with acceptable accuracy.
2. Analyzing the blow-up of solutions as time approaches $T_{bl}$ and determining specific numerical values for $T_{bl}$.
3. Establishing practical models for the blow-up of solutions in case of analysis failure.

## Methodology

The numerical analysis is based on the theoretical foundation presented. The key idea is to use Richardson's theory for effective accuracy evaluation, determining the effective accuracy order during the solution of smooth solutions.
