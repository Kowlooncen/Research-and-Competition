## Using drones to survey mangrove ecosystems biology competition

This study takes the mangrove ecosystems in Shenzhen and its surrounding areas as an example to explore the concept of ecological health. It combines unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology to acquire and quantitatively process ecological information, thereby quantitatively assessing the health level of the studied mangrove ecosystems. The main research content includes the following:

1. **Construction of a Precise Assessment Index System and Model for Mangrove Ecosystem Health:**
   - Building a precise assessment index system and model for mangrove ecosystem health based on ecological theories and on-site field investigations.

2. **Acquisition of Precise Health Assessment Indicators using Low-Altitude UAV Remote Sensing:**
   - Utilizing low-altitude UAV remote sensing to acquire precise health assessment indicators for the ecosystem.

3. **Application and Optimization of the Precise Health Assessment Model for Mangrove Ecosystems:**
   - Applying and optimizing the precise health assessment model for mangrove ecosystems.

4. **Analysis of Major Stress Factors on Mangrove Ecosystem Health and Proposal of Protective Measures:**
   - Analyzing the major stress factors affecting the health of mangrove ecosystems.
   - Proposing targeted protective measures to enhance the overall health of the mangrove ecosystems.
