# Population Growth and Medical Demand Prediction in Shenzhen

This article delves into the study of population growth and medical demand prediction in Shenzhen through the establishment of models, including Marhes's population index growth model, gray model, and linear fitting model.

## Question 1: Population Growth Modeling

### Registered Population
- Analyzing the changes in registered and non-registered populations over the past decade.
- Establishing Marhes's population index growth model for registered population.
- Utilizing triple exponential smoothing for predicting non-registered population.
- Building gray models for each age group and validating their feasibility.

### Population Forecasting
- Using models to predict Shenzhen's registered, non-registered populations, and age-specific numbers for the next decade.
- Employing linear fitting to forecast bed occupancy for the upcoming ten years.

## Question 2: Medical Demand Prediction

### Age Structure and Disease Characteristics
- Considering the relationship between age structure and disease characteristics.
- Determining the impact of population age structure on different diseases.

### Disease Incidence
- Calculating the number of patients based on high-risk populations for each disease.
  
### Bed Requirements
- Analyzing outpatient characteristics of various medical institutions.
- Determining bed requirements for different diseases in different types of medical institutions.

This comprehensive approach aims to provide insights into both population dynamics and medical demand, crucial for effective healthcare planning in Shenzhen.
