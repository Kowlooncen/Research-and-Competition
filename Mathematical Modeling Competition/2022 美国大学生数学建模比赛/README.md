# Cycling Performance Optimization

This repository focuses on optimizing pace strategy in road cycling, particularly in solo events like individual time trials (ITT). The goal is to enhance the existing 1D model proposed by De Jong and Fokkink to a more comprehensive 3D dynamic model, considering environmental factors and road conditions.

## Features

- **3D Dynamic Model:** Incorporates lateral and longitudinal bicycle dynamics, three-dimensional road geometry, and anaerobic source consumption.
- **Optimal Pace Strategy:** Derives optimal pace strategies for courses with varying slopes, wind directions, and conditions.
- **Athlete-Specific Simulations:** Simulates race schedules for different types of riders based on physiological and dynamic models.
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run simulations using provided physiological and dynamic models.
3. Analyze results for optimal pace strategies for different cycling conditions.
   
## Findings

- **Athlete-Specific Analysis:** Studied power (and speed) variations with position for different rider types on diverse courses.
- **Real Competition Data:** Validates the model with real competition data, such as the 2021 UCI World Championship time trial course.

## Sensitivity Analysis

- **Wind Influence:** Investigated the impact of wind speed and direction on time trial pace strategy through sensitivity analysis. Results suggest minimal influence.
- **Power Distribution Control:** Emphasizes the importance of controlling speed fluctuations during cornering to avoid premature exhaustion.

## Model Extension

Explores the extension of the model to team time trials, accommodating cyclists rolling closely together at high speeds.

## Recommendations

Provides valuable advice and race guidance for team directors (Directeur) and riders based on the optimized pace strategies.
