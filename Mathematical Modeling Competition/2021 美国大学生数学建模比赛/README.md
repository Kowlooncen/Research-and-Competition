# Asian Giant Hornet Detection System

This repository addresses the challenge of efficiently managing resources for the detection and verification of Asian giant hornet sightings, a potential threat to ecosystems and agriculture. In 2019, the invasive species was discovered in British Columbia, Canada, and later in Washington state. To streamline the government's response, we developed two models:

## Models

1. **Spatial Regression Model:** Enhances an existing regression analysis model by incorporating spatial variations. Predicts the future trends of Asian giant hornets in time and space.

2. **Error Classification Probability Model:** Custom-designed model categorizing information from reports and providing the probability of errors in the reported information.

## Objectives

- Efficiently assess information reliability.
- Quickly identify valid information.
- Provide priorities for professional researchers reviewing public reports.
- Optimize resource allocation for verification.

## Methodology

1. **Spatial Regression Model Application:** Predicts the spatial and temporal trends of Asian giant hornets based on regression analysis and spatial variations.

2. **Error Classification Probability Model Application:** Categorizes information from public reports, estimating the probability of errors.

3. **Results Comparison:** The dual-model approach allows for a rational analysis of the hornet crisis, aiding in the determination of government intervention strategies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the provided models on relevant datasets.
3. Review results and prioritize resources accordingly.
