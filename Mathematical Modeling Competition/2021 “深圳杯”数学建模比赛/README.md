# Mars Probe Landing Optimization

This repository addresses the optimization of the landing process for a Mars probe, considering complex factors such as atmospheric entry dynamics, uncertain parameters, and control constraints. The primary objectives include determining the shortest landing process time, minimizing energy consumption, and aligning the landing process with publicly available information.

## Models

1. **Optimal Landing Control Scheme:** Determines the optimal control sequence, including orbiter separation, parachute deployment, and engine ignition, for the shortest landing time.
2. **Energy-Minimizing Control Scheme:** Identifies the control scheme that minimizes energy consumption for a given landing time.
3. **Consistency with Public Information:** Explores how to design a control scheme that aligns with publicly available audio-visual and textual information.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Complex Atmospheric Entry:** Analyzes the probe's descent in the Martian atmosphere, addressing nonlinear constraints and uncertainties.
- **Nominal Trajectory Design:** Develops robust trajectory design methods considering various uncertainties during the trajectory design process.
- **Dynamic Mathematical Model:** Establishes a three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the probe during atmospheric entry.
