# Glass Classification and Weathering Analysis

Understanding the chemical composition and categories of glass, a significant trade commodity along ancient Silk Roads in China, provides insights into the development of ancient craftsmanship. This study, focusing on the relationship between glass surface weathering and its chemical composition, employs statistical learning methods to establish a glass classification model. The model is utilized for predicting unknown categories of glass artifacts based on their chemical composition.

## Objectives

1. **Surface Weathering Analysis:**
   - Investigate the relationship between surface weathering and glass types.
   - Analyze the chemical composition of glass.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Establish a glass classification model using statistical learning methods.
   - Predict unknown glass artifacts based on the developed model.

3. **Chemical Composition Trends:**
   - Explore statistical patterns in the chemical composition of weathered and non-weathered glass artifacts.

4. **Glass Subclassification:**
   - Use Random Forest classifier for supervised learning to predict glass subcategories.
   - Apply MeanShift algorithm for unsupervised learning to further classify lead-barium and high-potassium glass.

## Methodology

1. **Surface Weathering and Glass Types:**
   - Employ Pearson chi-square test to analyze the correlation between weathering and glass types.
   - Evaluate the statistical significance of weathering, glass type, and color.

2. **Chemical Composition Analysis:**
   - Utilize statistical feature extraction methods to describe the statistical patterns of chemical elements.
   - Visualize the changes in silicon dioxide, lead oxide, potassium oxide, and calcium oxide content post-weathering.

3. **Glass Classification Model:**
   - Develop a glass classification model using statistical learning and average backtracking.
   - Assess the model's reliability by comparing simulated race schedules with real competition data.

4. **Subclassification and Prediction:**
   - Employ Random Forest classifier to predict glass subcategories with 100% accuracy.
   - Implement MeanShift algorithm for subcategories within lead-barium and high-potassium glass.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Evaluate Spearman coefficients for chemical composition correlations within lead-barium and high-potassium glass.
   - Perform Friedman test to analyze compositional differences between different glass categories.

## Results and Implications

The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between glass weathering and chemical composition. The developed glass classification model showcases high accuracy, offering valuable insights for archaeologists and historians studying ancient craftsmanship. The findings contribute to the preservation and interpretation of glass artifacts along the ancient Silk Roads.
